#import data to run gams

#set up parallel processing,

#set PP loop to:
#run gam,
#run segment finder
#extract segment_summary (or just peark-trough summary?)
#extract key gam summary stats (edf, R^2?, AIC) - find a reason for these, if not, no
#stop parallel processing
#sort model variables in an organized way
#save to file (rda?)
